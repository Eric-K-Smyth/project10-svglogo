# Project 10 SVG Logo Gen
https://youtu.be/rB-mO84fMao Link to How it works
## Description
As a web developer I wanted a simple program to create simple logos for my projects so I don't have to pay a graphic designer. 
Through this project I learned how to ustilize Object Oriented Programming to create svg files based on user input, and NPM modules like jest to test to make sure they work.

## Installation

Open in VSCode and type node index.js Into the terminal.

## Usage

A series of prompts will apear, select them using the arrow keys. Once all the questions are answerd a logo.svg file will be created based on the selected answers.

## Tests

You can run 'npx jest shapes.test.js' in the shapes.test.js file to test if the shapes are created properly.
